#!/bin/sh
# uninstall.sh — report and remove Pipefy toolkit state across every install
# channel and MCP client.
#
# `--scan` reads and reports; it never removes, moves, or edits anything, and
# the only paths it writes are tempfiles holding its own record streams. Any
# other invocation scans, prints the plan it derived from that scan, asks for
# approval in tiers, removes what was approved, and scans again.
#
# Channels: the Claude Code plugin, a local install (install.sh / uv tool /
# uvx), and the hosted HTTP server. Clients come from CLIENT_TABLE below;
# adding one is a row there and no new code.
#
# A registration is matched on what it *runs*, not on what it is called. The
# registration key is free text — a real environment had the server registered
# as `pipefy-dev` — so keying on the name misses exactly the entries that
# shadow a working one. Matching stays structural: an exact command name, an
# exact argument, an exact URL host, a JSON key path, a TOML section header, a
# keychain service attribute, an exact environment variable name. Never a
# substring search: "pipefy" turns up in unrelated hostnames, mail addresses
# and directory names, and `env | grep -i pipefy` matches PWD for anyone
# working inside a directory named after it.
#
# An entry matches when *either* half of that rule fires: what it runs is this
# toolkit's server, or where it points is the hosted host. The two fields are
# read independently and a declared transport type is not a precondition for
# either, because which field a client honours differs between clients — Cursor
# and Codex read a `url` with no `type` as a remote server, Claude Code reads an
# entry with no `type` as stdio and skips it. Judging the shape by one client's
# rule leaves a registration the others do run invisible to the scan and alive
# after a teardown, so the shape is matched as written and the *report* carries
# the per-client caveat, driven off the `typed-remote` capability below.
#
# Removal uses what the scan found, including the name a registration was
# actually registered under, and every deletion goes through remove_path().
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing found / nothing left, 1 findings remain, 2 the run
# itself failed.

#   typed-remote   requires an explicit `type` on a remote entry: a `url` with

#                  line to the report saying it was not running here

# Direct file editing is the baseline for every row. Delegation is the
# exception one row happens to enable.

Usage: uninstall.sh [OPTIONS]

Report Pipefy toolkit state across every install channel and MCP client, then
remove what you approve. A bare invocation scans, shows the plan, and asks.

MCP registrations are matched on what they run — the $SERVER_BINARY
command, a known runner invoking it, or the hosted endpoint's host — so an
entry registered under any name is found, and removed under that name.

Options:
  --scan              Report state and exit. Changes nothing.
  --client <id>       Limit MCP registration edits to this client's config.
                      One of: $_choices.
                      Detection always sweeps every client regardless, since
                      the point is finding state you forgot about, and tools,
                      credentials, skills and the plugin are not narrowed.
  --dry-run           Print the plan and exit without removing anything.
  --yes, -y           Approve every tier. Required with no TTY.
  --keep-credentials  Leave stored credentials alone (skips tier 2).
  --keep-config       Leave user configuration alone: config.toml, .env, and
                      non-credential PIPEFY_* settings in your own files.
  --allow-root        Allow running as root (refuses by default).
  -h, --help          Show this help.

Approval is tiered, not per action:
  [1] ours and reversible   one confirmation for the whole group
  [2] credentials           its own confirmation; cannot be undone
  [3] your own files        its own confirmation; backed up first

Exit codes:
  0  nothing found, or nothing left after removal
  1  findings remain
  2  the run itself failed (a source could not be inspected)

  curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/uninstall.sh \\

# ------------------------------------------------------------ install receipt
#
# install.sh appends one key=value record per run to this file: the tool
# directory it used, whether it installed uv, which client entries it created
# rather than found, where the skills landed, and the release tag. Reading it
# is what makes a teardown exact instead of a guess.
#
# It is read with awk alone. python3 degrades per source in this script, and
# the receipt is one of the sources that has to keep working without it.
#
# It is also an input to a destructive program, so it is treated as untrusted
# text. A record whose schema this script does not know is skipped rather than
# half-read; a malformed line is counted and dropped; and no value from here
# ever names something to delete. Values only ever pick which directory to ask
# uv about, which skills directory to enumerate, and whether a registration the
# structural scan already found may be removed. The deletion guard in
# remove_path() is the backstop behind that, not the reason it holds.

# The receipt is installer state, not user configuration, so it lives under
# XDG_STATE_HOME rather than beside the config.toml the user wrote. That keeps
# it out of the directory this script empties and then removes, and out of the
# way of a user who backs up their own config.
