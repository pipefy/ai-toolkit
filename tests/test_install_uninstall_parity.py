"""``install.sh`` and ``uninstall.sh`` cannot drift apart.

Both halves are observed, never read out of the sources. What the installer
writes is the difference between two snapshots of a fixture ``HOME`` taken
around a real run; what the teardown accounts for is what a real
``uninstall.sh --yes`` against that same ``HOME`` leaves behind. A path a new
installer step creates therefore has to be reachable by the teardown or this
fails, and no one has to keep a hand-written inventory in step.

The stub ``PATH`` and the fixture ``HOME`` come from ``test_install_receipt``,
which is where ``install.sh``'s harness lives.
