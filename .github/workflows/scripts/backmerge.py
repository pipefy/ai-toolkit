"""Open the ``main`` -> ``dev`` back-merge pull request, or record why one could not be.

Anything merged directly into ``main`` -- a hotfix, a docs fix, a LICENSE --
leaves ``dev`` behind until a human remembers to back-merge. Nothing on the
GitHub side notices, so the drift is silent from the moment it happens until
the next release cut trips over it, which can be days later and is diagnosed by
whoever happens to be cutting rather than by whoever caused it.

``release.py release-pr`` already refuses to cut while ``origin/main`` carries
commits absent from ``origin/dev``. That guard turns a silent hazard into a hard
failure, but only at the *next* release -- the drift still persists for however
long passes before someone tries. This closes that window from the other side:
the reconciliation is waiting for review instead of waiting to be remembered.

Two constraints shape the design, both worth knowing before editing:

* **A pull request is mandatory.** The repository ruleset requires one, with an
  approving review, on both ``main`` and ``dev``, and blocks non-fast-forward
  pushes and deletion. This cannot push to ``dev`` and cannot merge its own
  pull request -- a human approval is the point. The job is to make sure the
  pull request *exists*.
* **A conflict is a normal outcome, not an error.** Release drift conflicts on
  ``CHANGELOG.md`` by construction (``main`` carries the stamped ``## [X.Y.Z]``
  heading while ``dev`` still has those entries under ``## [Unreleased]``), and
  binary assets conflict whenever both branches touched one. Neither is
  resolvable here: ``-X ours`` and ``-X theirs`` both silently discard real
  work. A conflict routes to the tracking issue and the run still exits zero,
  because a red run on every release trains people to ignore the signal.

Pull request #{merged_pr} is merged, yet `origin/{MAIN_BRANCH}` is still {behind} commit{plural} ahead of `origin/{DEV_BRANCH}`. That is what a squash or a rebase does to a back-merge: it applies every file and discards the second parent, so `{DEV_BRANCH}` gained the content but never the ancestry.

`git rev-list --count origin/{DEV_BRANCH}..origin/{MAIN_BRANCH}` cannot reach zero on its own from here, `release-pr` stays blocked, and this workflow would keep proposing the same back-merge. This pull request closes that loop.

## What it changes: nothing

The merge is `-s ours`. It takes no files from `{MAIN_BRANCH}` and records it as a parent, because #{merged_pr} already delivered every file. Confirm with one command — it prints nothing:

```bash
git fetch origin {branch}
git diff origin/{DEV_BRANCH} FETCH_HEAD
```

A plain merge is the wrong tool here. With no shared ancestry, git reads one paragraph on each side as two independent additions and keeps both, so it duplicates text `{DEV_BRANCH}` already carries.

## Merge this with a merge commit, not a squash

**Use "Create a merge commit".** Squashing this one discards the second parent again and leaves the count exactly where it is, which is the problem it exists to repair.

## Commits whose ancestry this restores

{listing}
{dco_section(dco)}
## Checks

{checks}

Opened automatically by `.github/workflows/backmerge.yml` after it found #{merged_pr} merged with the divergence still standing.
