# Uninstalling, and switching channels

`uninstall.sh` reports Pipefy toolkit state across every install channel and MCP client, then removes what you approve. It lives beside `install.sh` at the repository root.

```sh
# Report only. Removes nothing, edits nothing, moves nothing.
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit/main/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- --scan

# Scan, show the plan it derived, ask for approval in tiers, remove.
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

Piping into `sh` still prompts: the script reads its answers from `/dev/tty` when its own stdin is the pipe. Where there is no terminal at all — CI, a provisioning script — pass `--yes`, or the run refuses rather than assuming an answer.

## Scope

In scope: the CLI and MCP server installed as uv tools, MCP registrations in every client config, the Claude Code plugin and its marketplace, the skills `npx skills add` installed, stored credentials, `~/.config/pipefy`, shell completions, and `PIPEFY_*` assignments in your shell rc files and client `env` blocks.

Out of scope: your git checkouts. Uninstalling is about tooling, not source.

## Scan first

`--scan` reads and reports. The only paths it writes are its own tempfiles, and it never runs a client CLI that changes anything.

```sh
./uninstall.sh --scan
```

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | no Pipefy toolkit state found |
| `1` | findings remain |
| `2` | the run itself failed, or a source could not be inspected |

Exit `2` is the one worth reading carefully. Every JSON source — the client configs, the plugin registry, each project `.mcp.json`, the skills lock file — is read by a single `python3` program, and without `python3` those sources report `not inspected` rather than `clean`. A partial scan can therefore never be mistaken for a clean machine. The non-JSON sources (`PATH`, the keychain, `~/.config/pipefy`, completions, and the Codex TOML) are inspected with POSIX text tools alone. A credential store that cannot be enumerated counts the same way whatever the reason: no `security` on macOS and no `secret-tool` on Linux both report the keychain as uninspected and exit `2`.

Removal needs `python3`. Without it, a teardown planned from a partial scan would leave exactly the state that causes duplicate-registration conflicts, so the run refuses and points at `--scan`.

## A registration is matched on what it runs

The registration key is free text. A real environment had the server registered as `pipefy-dev`, so keying on the name misses exactly the entries that shadow a working one.

Detection is structural and exact — never a substring search for "pipefy", which turns up unrelated hostnames and directory names. An entry matches when **either** of these fires:

- its `command` is `pipefy-mcp-server`, or a known runner (`uvx`, `uv`, `npx`, `python`, `python3`, `pipx`) with `pipefy-mcp-server` as an exact argument
- its URL **host** is exactly `mcp.pipefy.com`

The two fields are read independently, and a declared transport `type` is required for neither. Clients disagree about what a `type`-less entry is: Cursor and Codex read a bare `url` as a remote server, while Claude Code reads an entry with no `type` as stdio and skips it with `has a "url" but no "type"`. Judging the shape by one client's rule would leave a registration the others do run invisible to the scan and alive after a teardown, so the entry is matched as written and the report adds the caveat where it applies — such an entry in Claude Code's config is reported as registered but not running, and is still removed.

Everything else that carries a weak signal — a name in this toolkit's namespace, one of its environment variables, some other Pipefy-shaped HTTP endpoint — is reported as unverified for you to judge, and never removed. The name an entry was really registered under is reported as data, and removal uses that name.

## Teardown

A bare invocation scans, prints the plan it derived from that scan, asks for approval, removes, then scans again — because "uninstalled" has to be an observed fact. A `uv tool uninstall` can succeed while a binary of the same name is still earlier on `PATH`.

### Approval is tiered, not per action

Around twenty individual prompts pushes everyone to `--yes` and loses the safety entirely. There are three:

| Tier | Contents | Undo |
|------|----------|------|
| `[1]` | what this toolkit installed, where a record says so | reinstalling restores it |
| `[2]` | stored credentials | cannot be undone |
| `[3]` | your own files | each is copied to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` before editing |

Declining a tier leaves everything in it untouched; the run continues with the others.

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--scan` | report and exit; changes nothing |
| `--dry-run` | scan, print the plan, exit without removing anything |
| `--yes`, `-y` | approve every tier; required when there is no terminal |
| `--keep-credentials` | skip tier 2 — stored credentials stay where they are |
| `--keep-config` | keep your own configuration: `config.toml`, `.env`, and non-credential `PIPEFY_*` settings in files you wrote |
| `--client <id>` | limit **registration edits** to one client's config (`claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, `codex`, `cursor`) |
| `--allow-root` | run as root, refused by default |

`--client` narrows what is edited, never what is looked at: detection always sweeps every client, since the point is finding state you forgot about, and tools, credentials, skills and the plugin are not narrowed by it.

`install.sh` also takes `--client none`, meaning *install without registering*. Teardown refuses that word. Because `--client` narrows registration edits and nothing else, `none` would edit no client config while still removing the binaries every config found points at, which is the stranding the phase order exists to prevent. Omit the flag to sweep every client.

### Order

The order is load-bearing, not cosmetic:

1. **Revoke.** Only `pipefy auth logout` reaches the identity provider, and that ability disappears with the tool environment, so it leads. A credential deleted locally but never revoked stays valid at the provider until it expires, and the report says so when that happens.
2. **Credentials.** The local stores, once revocation has had its chance.
3. **Shadowing registrations.** A local- or project-scope entry outranks the user-scope entry of the same name, and the next step has to be able to resolve that name.
4. **The hosted OAuth token.** `claude mcp logout <name>` resolves the name across scopes and takes no scope flag, so it runs after the entries that outrank the hosted one are gone and before the hosted entry itself is removed. It is a credential and belongs with step 2 by class; it sits here because it is the only credential whose store is reached through a registration. A run that cannot clear it says so and exits non-zero rather than reporting it cleared.
5. **Client configs.** Before the tools, so no registration is left pointing at a binary that no longer exists.
6. **Tools.**
7. **Skills.**
8. **Runtime state**, last: `pipefy auth logout` and `pipefy auth status` can recreate `~/.config/pipefy` with `refresh.lock`, and encrypted-session writes also create `session.enc.lock`. Cleanup includes locks created during logout, so clearing them any earlier clears nothing.

`~/.config/pipefy` is removed only if it ends up empty. Its presence after a later `pipefy` invocation is not a failed removal.

### The exit code means the same thing either way

A teardown uses the exit codes `--scan` uses, judged by the closing re-scan rather than by how many actions ran. A plan can be empty and the machine still not clean — a hand-edited Codex section, a registration a receipt records as pre-existing, anything a `--keep-*` flag held back — so `Nothing to remove.` exits `1` on exactly the tree where `--scan` exits `1`, and prints the *Left alone* and *Do this yourself* notes that say why nothing was planned.

### Removed means observed removed

`Removed:` is a verified word. Every action whose result the closing re-scan can check earns it by being checked. The hosted OAuth token cannot be: it lives in the client's own store, which is not readable from here, so `claude mcp logout` exiting `0` is the only signal and a no-op exits `0` too. That clear is reported under *Asked for, result not observable from here*, is never counted as a deleted credential, and makes the run exit `1` rather than `0` — the machine is not one this run can call clean. Confirm it with `/mcp`, pick the server, and read its authentication state.

### Skills are removed only where something records installing them

`pipefy-` is a namespace anyone may write in, and the directory name is not evidence of who wrote it. A skill is removed when the install receipt records this toolkit's installer adding it, or when the lock file `skills add` keeps records its source as this repository; anything else under the same prefix is reported and left where it is. A skill directory is often a link into a shared store, so the store content and the lock entry go with the link rather than being stranded behind it — but only where the link points inside that store. Following a link is unbounded reach, so a link out to anything else costs the link and nothing more, and the report says where the content it pointed at was left.

`skills add` has two layouts and both are read. A global install keeps its lock at `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`; an install run from inside a project keeps it at `<project>/skills-lock.json` and links a skills directory beside it. The store is `<base>/.agents/skills` in both, which is why it is derived from the base the lock was found at rather than from wherever the lock itself sits. The lock file is `skills add`'s own and may record skills from several sources, so this run drops its own entries and removes the file only when those were the only ones in it.

## The install receipt, and heuristic mode

`install.sh` appends one record per run to `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/pipefy/install-receipt`, including whether it *created* each client registration or found one already there and left it. With that record, teardown removes the entry it made and leaves the entry you made.

Without a receipt the run is in **heuristic mode**, which is permanent rather than transitional: every install made before the receipt existed has none, and only a version of `install.sh` that writes one produces one. Heuristic mode removes less. In a config the installer writes, it deletes a registration only where the value is exactly the single command the installer writes, reports everything else for you to judge, and never treats uv as this toolkit's.

## The stored session lives in one of three places

`PIPEFY_KEYCHAIN_BACKEND=file` puts the session in `~/.config/pipefy/keyring.cfg`; `encrypted` puts it in `session.enc` (plus `wrapping.key` on Windows, and a `pipefy-wrapping-key` Keychain item on macOS). Without either override, the session is in the OS keychain. Removing that setting **moves the store** rather than clearing it: the next login writes to the keychain while anything already in `keyring.cfg` / `session.enc` stays there, still signed in and invisible to a keychain-only sweep. The scan resolves and reports the effective backend and checks the OS keychain, `keyring.cfg`, `session.enc`, and wrapping artifacts regardless of which store is active.

## Never removed, by design

- **uv itself**, and the `PATH` lines its installer added to your shell rc. By now other tools depend on it, and a uv tool directory is not uv. Edit those lines yourself if you want them gone.
- **The uv cache.** Never run a bare `uv cache clean`: with no package argument it clears the cache for every package on the machine, and uv hardlinks tool environments into it, so an already-running MCP server breaks with a missing-module error until its client restarts. `uv cache prune` is the safe form, and only while nothing is running.
- **Editable-install entries in the uv cache** (`archive-v0/*_editable_impl_*.pth`). They belong to other repositories' virtualenvs; removing one breaks that checkout until its next sync.
- **A git-tracked `.mcp.json`.** Editing it is not durable — the next checkout, branch switch, or stash pop restores it from the index — so the entry is disabled through `disabledMcpjsonServers` instead.
- **A `pipefy` binary inside a project virtualenv.** It is reported for shadowing purposes and classified as belonging to that checkout.
- **A `pipefy-*` skill nothing records this toolkit installing.** See above.
- **Whatever a skill entry links out to, when that target is outside `<base>/.agents/skills` for the base its lock file was found at.** The link is this toolkit's and goes; the directory it pointed at is reported and left.
- **A Codex `[mcp_servers.<name>]` section with anything beyond the single line the installer appends**, including a `[mcp_servers.<name>.env]` sub-table beside it. The section and the sub-table are separate headers, so excising one would strand the other and whatever it holds; both are reported instead.
- **A marketplace clone recorded outside the client's own plugin directory.** `installLocation` is data this script did not write, so it is checked against the canonical clone path and reported when it does not match.
- **Your git checkouts.**

## Two things that come back

**The marketplace.** Unregistering it is not necessarily durable: a later session re-adds it from a settings file that still lists it under `extraKnownMarketplaces`, or from a plugin that still needs it. Clear those entries too, then confirm with a fresh session rather than trusting the first removal.

**A git-tracked `.mcp.json`.** See above: disable, do not edit.

## Switching channels

There are four ways to run the Pipefy MCP server: the **hosted** HTTPS endpoint, a **local** install (`install.sh`, `uv tool`, or `uvx`), the **Claude Code plugin**, and the **Cursor Marketplace plugin**. Register exactly one of them at a time — a duplicate registration under a second name shadows the one you meant to use, and precedence runs local → project → user → plugin-provided → connectors, with the whole entry taken from the winning source and no merging across scopes.

Switching is *remove the old channel, then add the new one*. Scan first to find what is actually registered, since it may not be called `pipefy`:

```sh
./uninstall.sh --scan
```

### To hosted

```sh
claude mcp remove <name> -s user          # the name the scan printed
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user --client-id pipefy-mcp pipefy https://mcp.pipefy.com/mcp
```

Complete the browser login when prompted, or run `claude mcp login pipefy` if the client reports *Needs authentication*. The hosted server exposes the remote-safe surface: everything except the tools whose input is a file on your machine.

Coming from the plugin, uninstall the plugin as well — a plugin-provided server ranks below user scope, so removing only the user-scope entry falls through to the plugin's own `.mcp.json` (hosted `mcp.pipefy.com`):

```text
/plugin uninstall pipefy@pipefy
/plugin marketplace remove pipefy
```

### To a local install

```sh
claude mcp logout <name>                  # hosted OAuth token, per server
claude mcp remove <name> -s user
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --client cursor              # or claude-code, claude-desktop, codex, none
pipefy auth login
```

`claude mcp logout` clears the stored OAuth credentials for that one server. When the verb is unavailable, run `/mcp`, pick the server, and choose **Clear authentication**. Teardown probes for the verb rather than inferring it from a client version, and falls back to telling you to do it by hand.

### To the plugin

```text
/plugin marketplace add pipefy/ai-toolkit
/plugin install pipefy
/pipefy:install
/pipefy:pipefy-login
```

Remove the hosted or hand-wired registration first, for the same precedence reason.

### To the Cursor Marketplace plugin

In Cursor, the Marketplace plugin and any user-config Pipefy MCP entry (including `install.sh --client cursor`) both occupy the MCP list. Keep exactly one. This path has no `/install` or `/pipefy-login` commands (those files belong to Claude Code, where they surface namespaced as `/pipefy:install` and `/pipefy:pipefy-login`). Skills may appear as `/pipefy-*` palette entries.

1. If `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`) has a matching server, delete that key and save the file. The name is free text — `./uninstall.sh --scan` prints it.
2. Install **Pipefy** from the Cursor Marketplace (the listing tracks `main`). Contributors loading a checkout copy the plugin files into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/pipefy` as a real directory and fully restart Cursor. Cursor rejects a symlink whose target is outside `~/.cursor/plugins/local`. The copy commands are in the root README, [Cursor Marketplace plugin](../README.md#6-cursor-marketplace-plugin).
3. Complete Cursor's browser sign-in. Do not run `pipefy auth login` or `/pipefy:pipefy-login` on this path.

`./uninstall.sh --scan` still reports a leftover **user-config** `mcp.pipefy.com` or `pipefy-mcp-server` registration. A Marketplace-only install does not write `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. A clean scan (exit `0`) means no **user-config** registration was found in the sources the scan inspects; it does not mean the machine is free of Pipefy state. The scan does not read `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json`, and it does not clear the Cursor-held OAuth credential (sign out from Cursor's MCP pane, the same one that ran the sign-in; `pipefy auth logout` does not apply on a path with no CLI). Disable or uninstall the plugin itself from Cursor's plugin pane when leaving this path. The two panes are separate: signing out does not remove the plugin, and removing the plugin does not clear the credential.

## Removing pieces by hand

The scan prints this list too, filled in with the names it found:

| Piece | Command |
|-------|---------|
| local install | `uv tool uninstall pipefy-cli pipefy-mcp-server` |
| Claude Code MCP | `claude mcp remove <name> -s user` (also `-s local`) |
| Claude Code plugin | `/plugin uninstall pipefy@pipefy`, then `/plugin marketplace remove pipefy` |
| Cursor Marketplace plugin | uninstall from Cursor Plugins; remove `~/.cursor/plugins/local/pipefy` if you copied or linked a checkout (`rm` a symlink, `rm -rf` a copy) |
| other clients | delete the `mcpServers.<name>` key, or the `[mcp_servers.<name>]` section for Codex |
| credentials | `pipefy auth logout` |
| hosted OAuth token | `claude mcp logout <name>` |
| macOS keychain item | `security delete-generic-password -s pipefy` |
| macOS wrapping key | `security delete-generic-password -s pipefy-wrapping-key -a aes-256-gcm` |
| Windows wrapping key | delete `wrapping.key` under the Pipefy config directory |

Use the names the report printed: a registration can be called anything.
