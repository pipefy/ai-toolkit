# Cross-cutting tool behavior

Conventions shared across many MCP tools. Per-area details (parameters, edge cases) stay in the guides linked from the [main README](../../../README.md#mcp-server).

## Pagination

List-style tools accept `first` and `after`. Continue with `pageInfo.endCursor` while `pageInfo.hasNextPage` is true.

## IDs

Pipefy GraphQL uses string IDs. Pass IDs as strings (e.g. `"301234"`). Some parameters also accept JSON integers; the server normalizes to string before calling the API. Success payloads return string IDs. Empty, zero, or otherwise invalid IDs fail validation before any network call.

Which **form** each tool expects (slug vs `internal_id` vs uuid vs numeric id) is the canonical [Identifiers map](identifiers.md#the-four-forms). Type-safety and coercion detail: [Pipefy IDs and type safety](pipes-and-cards.md#pipefy-ids-type-safety).

## `debug=true`

On failures, error text may include GraphQL codes and a `correlation_id` for support.

## `extra_input`

Optional map of extra mutation fields (camelCase keys). Keys that duplicate the tool's primary parameters are ignored.

## Destructive operations

MCP destructive operations are server-enforced two-step. The first call, with default `confirm=false` or with `confirm=true` and no valid token, does not mutate. It returns a preview whose payload includes a top-level `confirmation_token`, and the same token appears in `message`. The second call must set `confirm=true` and echo that `confirmation_token`. A one-shot `confirm=true` with no token still returns the preview.

The token binds to one tool and one resource identity. It is HMAC-signed and replayable within a 300-second TTL; the server does not store it. Hosted verify is stateless HMAC derived from the bearer, so any replica can check the same confirmation token, and a token minted for one caller does not verify for another. On a local stdio server the key is a per-process secret instead, so tokens do not survive a server restart.

Step 2 must repeat the same selecting arguments as step 1, because they are what the token binds to. A rejected confirm does not return the old token: it returns a fresh preview, a new `confirmation_token`, and a sentence saying whether the previous token was missing, invalid or expired, or bound to a different tool and resource. Retrying with the token already in hand cannot make progress; use the new one.

This is not a human click. A client that auto-approves tool calls can preview and confirm back to back with no human involved. The guarantee is that the preview reached the transcript, nothing more.

`execute_graphql` queries stay ungated. Mutations need the same confirmation token, and the token binds to the document and the variables, so changing either one invalidates it. The preview names the mutation but does not claim it is irreversible: the server cannot tell create from delete. Tokens are replayable, so a non-idempotent mutation can run twice if resent within the TTL. Prefer dedicated tools for those writes.

Both `execute_graphql` and `pipefy graphql exec` refuse a document too deeply nested to parse, and nothing is sent. The server cannot tell whether such a document is a query or a mutation, so it declines to classify rather than run it unconfirmed. The ceiling is the parser's remaining stack headroom rather than a fixed depth, so the same document can be accepted by one surface and refused by another. Reduce the nesting and retry.

`call_ipaas_tool` is gated when the **call** is judged destructive, in this order: catalog `annotations.destructiveHint` true, then `arguments.operation` needle-equality after strip and casefold against `delete`, `remove`, `destroy`, `drop`, `uninstall`, `revoke`, then annotation false stops, else the catalog name is matched as a substring against those same needles. A catalog miss (the name was not on the page this server read) is unclassifiable and takes the two-step as well. Mixed manage calls with `operation=DELETE` are two-step; `ADD` and `UPDATE` stay one-shot as long as no `confirmation_token` is supplied. Passing a token routes the call through the guard whatever the classification, so a leftover `DELETE` token cannot execute an `ADD`; the reply says the call is not classified as destructive and hands back a fresh token.

The iPaaS token binds to the whole `arguments` map, not only the operation. Step 2 must send the same arguments as step 1: key order does not matter, and `operation` is compared after strip and casefold, so `DELETE`, `delete`, and `DELETE ` confirm each other. Changing any other value invalidates the token. The preview echoes that map in `resource` and `message`, so anything passed as an argument, including a value that identifies a customer record, appears in the transcript the caller shows for approval.

CLI destructive commands confirm with `--yes` (or an interactive prompt) and do not use confirmation tokens. MCP uses the two-step confirmation token. `unpublish_sub_portal` stays ungated.

Some destructive tools can attach extra **dependents** context in the preview when optional scope arguments are provided (e.g. `pipe_id` for `delete_label` / `delete_phase`, `phase_id` for `delete_phase_field`) so agents see related automations, field conditions, or label usage before confirming.

## `PERMISSION_DENIED` enrichment

On cross-pipe operations (relations, AI agents), errors carrying `extensions.code = PERMISSION_DENIED` are enriched with a membership hint pointing to `invite_members` when the service account is missing from the target pipe. Runs automatically (no `debug=true` required); implementation in [`enrich_permission_denied_error`](../../../packages/mcp/src/pipefy_mcp/tools/graphql_error_helpers.py).

### Card reads and `PERMISSION_DENIED`

Pipefy often returns **`PERMISSION_DENIED`** for `card(id: …)` when the card was **deleted** or the token cannot see it, and the API does not always distinguish those cases. After a successful `delete_card`, `pipefy card get` may still surface `PERMISSION_DENIED` for that id; treat it as "inaccessible or removed", not necessarily a failed delete. The CLI adds a short hint on `pipefy card get` when this code appears.

## Pre-flight validation for AI features

Before creating/updating AI automations or AI agents, call [`validate_ai_automation_prompt`](automations-and-ai.md#ai-automations) and [`validate_ai_agent_behaviors`](automations-and-ai.md#ai-agent-read-delete) to catch prompt, field, and event errors and membership gaps without round-tripping the write mutation.

## Introspection

`introspect_type`, `introspect_query`, and `introspect_mutation` expose live schema; `search_schema` lists types by keyword (optional `kind` filter). Use `max_depth` where supported to expand nested types in one round trip. Set `include_parsed=true` to also receive a `data` dict for programmatic access.

## Error payloads

When a GraphQL exception carries a structured `errors` list, error payloads return the extracted `message` strings (without a noisy `str(exc)` wrapper that would include `locations` / `extensions`). The raw string is used as a fallback only when no structured messages can be extracted.

### Non-blank failure messages

The MCP `tool_error` envelope replaces empty or whitespace-only messages with `Tool request failed.`. Existing non-blank messages, codes, and details are preserved, including domain-specific recovery instructions. This fallback supplies no evidence that a write failed before applying its effect; verify the resource before retrying an ambiguous write.

This invariant applies to MCP envelopes only. CLI error rendering is unchanged; it does not use `tool_error`, and source-specific SDK error normalization remains in place.
