# Members, Email & Webhooks

Manage pipe membership, send emails from card inboxes, read inbox replies, and manage webhooks (list, create, update, delete). **12 tools.**

---

## Member management

| Tool | Read-only | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `invite_members` | No | Invite one or more users to a pipe by email; `members` is a list of dicts with `email` and `role_name`. |
| `add_service_account_to_pipe` | No | Attach an existing organization service account to a pipe by `email` (iPaaS setup); `role_name` defaults to `admin`. Wraps `inviteMembers` and verifies membership afterwards, so an incomplete setup is not reported as success. |
| `remove_member_from_pipe` | No | Permanently remove one or more users from a pipe (`destructiveHint=True`; [two-step](cross-cutting.md#destructive-operations) with `confirmation_token`). |
| `set_role` | No | Set a member's role on a pipe (`member_id`, `role_name`). |

## Email tools

| Tool | Read-only | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `get_email_templates` | Yes | List email templates for a pipe or table (`repo_id`); optional `filter_by_name`. Use before `send_email_with_template` to discover template IDs. Lists only; it cannot create or change a template. |
| `get_card_inbox_emails` | Yes | List emails (sent and received) for a card's inbox. Use `email_type: 'received'` to get only replies. |
| `send_inbox_email` | No | Send an email from a card's inbox; requires the card to have an email inbox enabled. `from_` (sender) is required. |
| `send_email_with_template` | No | Send an email using a template that already exists. Resolves placeholders (e.g. `{{card.title}}`). `card_id`, `email_template_id` required; optional `to`, `from_` to override defaults. |

Hard stop: creating, editing and deleting email templates is not part of the API or MCP surface. The GraphQL schema has no template CRUD mutation, so the only path is the Pipefy UI. A flow that needs a new or edited template carries a manual UI step, and that step belongs in the plan handed to the user before any build starts.

## Webhook tools

| Tool | Read-only | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `get_webhooks` | Yes | Lists webhooks for a pipe (`id`, `name`, `url`, `actions`, `headers`, `email`). |
| `create_webhook` | No | Register a webhook for pipe events; `url` must be HTTPS; `actions` is a list of event names (e.g. `['card.move', 'card.create']`). Use `introspect_type('WebhookActions')` for valid actions. |
| `update_webhook` | No | Patch an existing webhook (`webhook_id`, optional `name`, `url`, `actions`, `headers`). `headers` replaces the whole set: a key left out is deleted, so send every header to keep. |
| `delete_webhook` | No | Permanently delete a webhook by ID (`destructiveHint=True`; [two-step](cross-cutting.md#destructive-operations) with `confirmation_token`). |
