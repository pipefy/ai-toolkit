# Migration Guide — v0.1 Cutover (pipefy-mcp-server → ai-toolkit)

Existing users of `pipefy-mcp-server`: this guide covers what changed and what to do. **TL;DR:** almost nothing breaks.

---

## Package name — unchanged

`pipefy-mcp-server` is the same PyPI package name as before, so your `pip install pipefy-mcp-server` or `uvx pipefy-mcp-server` keeps working. Pre-release 0.x builds now publish to PyPI on every tag under this name; while only pre-releases exist a plain install resolves the latest one, and a stable release becomes the default at v1.0.

**Pre-launch (0.x):** install the latest pre-release from PyPI:

```sh
uvx pipefy-mcp-server
```

---

## MCP client config — unchanged

Your existing Cursor, Claude Desktop, or Claude Code JSON config needs **no changes**. The entry point (`pipefy-mcp-server`) and tool names are identical.

Example Cursor config (still valid):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipefy": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["pipefy-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Tool names and parameters — unchanged

All MCP tools keep the same names, parameters, and behavior as in the pre-monorepo server, except that the email send tools now ask for confirmation (below). No renames, no removed tools. If you have agent prompts or workflows referencing specific tool names, they continue to work.

---

## Email sends need confirmation

`send_inbox_email` and `send_email_with_template` no longer send on the first call. The first call returns a preview of the message (under `email`) with a `confirmation_token`; the email goes out only when the call is repeated with `confirm=true` and that token, the same [two-step](mcp/tools/cross-cutting.md#destructive-operations) the destructive tools use. A caller that sent in one call now gets `success: false` with `requires_confirmation: true` and must make the second call.

On the CLI, `pipefy email inbox send` and `pipefy email template send` print the email and exit 2 unless `--yes` is set. Scripts that send mail need `--yes`.

---

## Repo URL

The toolkit lives in the **Pipefy org** at **[github.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit](https://github.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit)**. Earlier names of this repository (`pipefy-mcp-server`, `pipefy-labs`) may still redirect on GitHub; update remotes and install URLs when you can.

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pipefy/ai-toolkit.git
```

Pre-1.0 installs the latest pre-release from PyPI:

```sh
uvx pipefy-mcp-server
```

---

## New in v0.1

These are new additions — all optional to adopt:

**`pipefy-cli`** — a terminal CLI with the same capabilities as the MCP server.

```sh
uvx --from pipefy-cli pipefy card get 12345
```

**`skills/` catalog** — Anthropic Skills-format playbooks for common Pipefy workflows, consumable by any LLM agent. Install via [`skills.sh`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add pipefy/ai-toolkit                           # all skills
npx skills add pipefy/ai-toolkit --skill pipefy-pipes-and-cards
```

---

## Environment variables — mostly unchanged

The same `PIPEFY_*` variables work for both MCP and CLI. A working `.env` for `pipefy-mcp-server` gives you `pipefy-cli` auth immediately. See [`docs/config.md#environment-variables`](config.md#environment-variables) for the full list.

One rename in the upcoming `0.2.0-beta.x` line is covered below.

---

## Service-account env-var rename

The three OAuth 2.0 client-credentials vars used by the service-account auth path are being renamed for clarity (and to remove the one-letter footgun against `PIPEFY_AUTH_URL`, the new OIDC user-login issuer):

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `PIPEFY_OAUTH_URL` | _dropped_ — set `PIPEFY_BASE_URL` instead (the OAuth token endpoint derives from `<base>/oauth/token`) |
| `PIPEFY_OAUTH_CLIENT` | `PIPEFY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID` |
| `PIPEFY_OAUTH_SECRET` | `PIPEFY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_SECRET` |

**No immediate action required for `_CLIENT` / `_SECRET`.** The legacy `PIPEFY_OAUTH_CLIENT` / `_SECRET` env vars flow through an alias shim and populate the renamed fields. The first command run with a legacy name set prints a one-shot stderr deprecation warning naming the replacement.

**`PIPEFY_OAUTH_URL` is gone.** It has no alias. Operators with this env var set will see the OAuth token endpoint silently fall back to `<PIPEFY_BASE_URL>/oauth/token` (default `https://app.pipefy.com/oauth/token`). Set `PIPEFY_BASE_URL` to your API host root for non-prod environments.

When you're ready to update:

1. Search-and-replace your shell, `.env`, MCP client JSON, and CI secrets per the table above.
2. Optionally re-run any command (e.g. `pipefy org get --json`) to confirm the deprecation warning is gone.

The legacy names will be removed in a later `0.2.0-beta.x` release; the change will carry an explicit breaking-change callout in the changelog at that time.

`PIPEFY_TOKEN` (static bearer override) and `PIPEFY_AUTH_URL` / `PIPEFY_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` (interactive user-login flow) are **not** affected.

---

## Settings model split (library / script users only)

End users of `pipefy-cli` and `pipefy-mcp-server` are unaffected — every `PIPEFY_*` env var and `.env` entry keeps loading exactly as before. The split matters only if you construct settings types directly in Python code that depends on `pipefy`.

Auth-related fields have moved from `PipefySettings` (which now owns endpoint config only) to `pipefy_auth.AuthSettings`. URL endpoints (graphql, internal_api, interfaces, service_account) are now `@computed_field` properties derived from `base_url`:

| Was on `pipefy_sdk.PipefySettings` | Now |
|---|---|
| `graphql_url` (settable) | `@computed_field` on `PipefySettings`, derived from `base_url` |
| `internal_api_url` (settable) | `@computed_field` on `PipefySettings`, derived from `base_url` |
| `interfaces_graphql_url` (settable) | `@computed_field` on `PipefySettings`, derived from `base_url` |
| `service_account_url` (settable) | `@computed_field` on `AuthSettings`, derived from `base_url` |
| `service_account_client_id` | `AuthSettings.service_account_client_id` |
| `service_account_client_secret` | `AuthSettings.service_account_client_secret` |
| (read from env only) | `AuthSettings.auth_url`, `auth_client_id`, `static_token` |

Because `PipefySettings` / `AuthSettings` are configured with `extra="ignore"`, code that still passes the old kwargs (`PipefySettings(graphql_url=...)`, `AuthSettings(service_account_url=...)`) **silently drops them** — no exception, no warning. Migrate by using `base_url` and composing the two models side by side:

```python
from pipefy_auth import AuthSettings
from pipefy_sdk import PipefySettings

pipefy = PipefySettings(base_url="https://app.pipefy.com")
auth = AuthSettings(
    service_account_client_id="...",
    service_account_client_secret="...",
)
# Computed properties:
pipefy.graphql_url            # "https://app.pipefy.com/graphql"
auth.service_account_url      # "https://app.pipefy.com/oauth/token"
```

If you already build a `pipefy-mcp-server` or `pipefy-cli` settings object, the application-level `Settings` / `CliSettings` already nests both:

```python
from pipefy_mcp.settings import Settings

s = Settings()  # s.pipefy + s.auth, env-loaded
```

The legacy `PIPEFY_OAUTH_*` env-var aliases and the deprecation warning live on `AuthSettings`; behaviour is preserved through the rename window above.
