# install.sh — one-command installer for Pipefy CLI + MCP server.
#
# Resolves the latest GitHub Release tag (or a tag passed via --version),
# discovers its wheel assets, installs the CLI and MCP server via
# `uv tool install`, optionally installs skills via `npx skills add`, and
# writes the MCP server registration into the chosen client's config.
#
# "Latest" deliberately excludes alpha tags: those are staging cuts off `dev`,
# published for the hosted MCP server to pin, and must never be what this
# installer hands out. Pass --version to install one on purpose.

Usage: install.sh [OPTIONS]

Install the Pipefy CLI and MCP server via uv, optionally add skills,
and register the MCP server with an MCP client.

Options:
  --yes, -y           Skip all confirmation prompts.
  --no-skills         Skip the skills installation step.
  --client <id>       Register MCP server in this client's config.
                      One of: claude-code, claude-desktop, cursor, codex, none.
                      Defaults to 'none' (prints snippet to paste).
  --version <tag>     Install a specific GitHub Release tag (e.g. v0.2.0-beta.2).
                      Defaults to the most recent release, skipping staging
                      alphas; pass the tag to install one of those on purpose.
  --prefix <dir>      Pass through as UV_TOOL_DIR for uv tool install.
  --allow-root        Allow running as root (refuses by default).
  --dry-run           Print commands without executing them.
  -h, --help          Show this help.

Examples:
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/install.sh \\
    | sh -s -- --client cursor

  ./install.sh --yes --client claude-desktop
  ./install.sh --dry-run --version v0.2.0-beta.2

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ receipt
#
# What this run did, so uninstall.sh can be exact instead of guessing: which
# tool directory the tools went into, whether uv was already here, whether a
# client registration was created or found already present, where the skills
# landed, and which release this was.
#
# Plain key=value, parsed with POSIX text tools alone. The JSON merge below
# needs python3; teardown must not inherit that, so nothing about this format
# does.
#
# One record per run, appended and never rewritten, so a second run with a
# different --client does not erase the first. Each line is written as its step
# succeeds, so an install that dies halfway still leaves the steps that did
# happen; the closing `record=end` is what says the run finished.
#
# A value occupies exactly one line: backslash, tab, carriage return and
# newline are written as \\, \t, \r and \n. `=` needs no escaping because a
# reader splits on the first one only, and a space needs none because nothing
# splits on whitespace.

# The receipt is installer state, not user configuration. ~/.config/pipefy is
# the user's, holds a file they authored, and is removed by teardown once it is
# empty; state belongs under XDG_STATE_HOME, resolved the way
# pipefy_infra.config.config_dir() resolves XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
