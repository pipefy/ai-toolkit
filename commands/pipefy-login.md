If `command -v pipefy` fails, stop and tell the user to run `/pipefy:install` first.

Otherwise prompt the user to confirm running:

```sh
pipefy auth login $ARGUMENTS
```

This targets Pipefy production by default. Only set `PIPEFY_AUTH_URL` (the OIDC issuer URL) in the shell environment when logging in to a non-prod IdP; it defaults to `https://signin.pipefy.com/realms/pipefy`.
