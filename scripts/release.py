"""Release orchestrator: run the steps in RELEASE.md as one guided CLI.

The release has a single natural fault line: ``git push origin <tag>`` triggers
PyPI publishing, which cannot be undone. Everything before it is local and
reversible; everything after is read-only verification. So this tool splits
into subcommands with a review gate between the reversible and irreversible
halves:

* ``release-pr`` — branch off the latest ``origin/dev``, bump, stamp CHANGELOG,
  push, and open a release PR into ``main``. Reversible; the PR review is the
  gate.
* ``alpha-pr`` — the same, based on ``dev``, for a staging alpha.
* ``prepare`` — bump and commit locally, without opening anything.
* ``publish`` — build and smoke-install the wheels, then tag, push the tag, watch
  the Release workflow, and verify. Asks for one explicit confirmation before the
  irreversible push.
* ``verify`` — re-run the post-publish checks for a tag.

Which branch a release ships from follows from the version itself, not the
operator's checkout (``release_branch_for``): **alphas ship from ``dev``** as
staging cuts, **betas and stables ship from ``main``**. The flows differ in more
than the branch — an alpha does not stamp the CHANGELOG, so consecutive alphas
share one accumulating ``## [Unreleased]`` section that the eventual beta
promotion stamps in full.

A repository ruleset requires a pull request on both ``main`` and ``dev``, so no
flow here pushes a release branch: the bump commit always arrives via a merged
release PR, and ``publish`` only ever pushes the tag (tags are unrestricted).

The version transform itself is NOT reimplemented here: ``bump_version.py``
stays the sole owner of which files carry the version and how they are
rewritten (it is pure, offline, and separately tested). This orchestrator
shells out to it for the bump and imports it only for read-only lookups.

Verification (also runnable on its own via ``verify <tag>``) asserts three
things, so none of them can be forgotten: the GitHub Release ships all five
wheels, the published version installs from PyPI, and the ``install.sh``
dry-run resolves the just-cut tag.

The reversible half also carries the one check no diff can show: the wheels are
built and installed into a throwaway virtualenv before the confirmation prompt,
because a release can break with nothing in this repository changing (see
``smoke_build_and_install``).
