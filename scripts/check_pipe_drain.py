"""A consumer fed by one of this script's own functions has to read to the end.

``client_rows``, ``all_client_rows`` and ``records`` emit a line at a time. A
consumer that stops early — ``break`` out of a ``while read``, ``exit`` from an
awk rule, ``head``, ``grep -q`` — closes the read end while the producer is
still writing, and the producer's next write gets EPIPE. dash reports that as
``printf: I/O error`` on stderr, from a scan that is supposed to write nothing
there.

It cannot be caught by running the thing. Whether the producer is still writing
when the consumer leaves depends on how much fits in the pipe buffer, so the
same code reproduces on one platform and not another, which is how the last one
survived a fix for its siblings. This asserts the shape instead: no early exit
in a pipeline whose producer is a function defined in the file.

An ``exit`` inside an awk ``END`` block is not an early exit — END runs after
the input is consumed — so those are allowed and are how these consumers say
"found it" without leaving early.

Usage: check_pipe_drain.py [path/to/uninstall.sh ...]
