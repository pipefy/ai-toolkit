"""In-memory server/client harness for the tool tests.

``mcp`` 2.0 removed ``mcp.shared.memory.create_connected_server_and_client_session``
in favour of ``mcp.client.Client``, which takes an ``MCPServer`` directly and owns
the in-memory transport and the handshake. Every tool test drives a server through
this one function, so the swap lives here rather than in the 29 test modules that
call it.

Kept as a function with the old name and signature so a test reads the same before
and after: ``async with create_connected_server_and_client_session(server) as
session``. The object yielded is a ``Client``, not a ``ClientSession``. For the two
methods the suite uses (``call_tool`` and ``list_tools``) the call shape is
identical; a test that reaches for a paginated ``list_*`` needs ``cursor=`` rather
than ``params=PaginatedRequestParams(...)``.

``mode="legacy"`` is the deliberate default. ``Client`` otherwise negotiates
2026-07-28, where the server cannot call the client, and the elicitation tests in
``tools/test_pipe_tools.py`` drive exactly that back channel. ``create_card`` and
``fill_card_phase_fields`` are the only tools that elicit (the destructive-tool
guard deliberately does not). Legacy also matches what this server negotiates in
production today, so the suite exercises the protocol revision the deployment
actually serves.

Adopting 2026-07-28 is separate work from the SDK upgrade: the two are separable. Flipping the ``setdefault`` below is one line, and it comes last:
under that revision elicitation is unavailable, so the two eliciting tools have to
move to ``InputRequiredResult`` to keep collecting field values interactively, and
the ``ctx.debug`` / ``ctx.info`` calls across the tool modules stop reaching clients
that do not set ``logging.optInLogMessages``. Both migrations belong in the same
piece of work as the flip. ``tests/test_protocol_handshake.py`` asserts the
negotiated revision directly, so a flip (deliberate or accidental) fails there
rather than only as a cluster of confusing elicitation failures.
