The counterpart to :mod:`pipefy_mcp.auth.request_identity` (which extracts the
*inbound* bearer a caller presents): these types resolve the *outbound*
``httpx.Auth`` the per-request SDK session binds. The two profiles pick a
different variant at the composition root, and both speak one ``resolve`` contract
so the runtime opens every session uniformly.
