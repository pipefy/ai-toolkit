    settings into wired resources: the outbound identity (whose :meth:`resolve`
    backs each request's session) and, under the ``remote`` profile, the inbound
    resource-server ``(verifier, auth)`` pair the SDK uses to validate each caller's
    bearer. It owns the process-scoped :class:`PipefyEngine` (the shared endpoints and
    GraphQL schema cache, built auth-agnostic with no network I/O) and opens a cheap
    per-request session bound to the caller's identity.

    The HTTP transport's DNS-rebinding allowlist is deliberately not held here. The
    SDK takes it per transport, on ``streamable_http_app()``, so it travels with the
    serving call instead: :func:`pipefy_mcp.server.run_server` resolves it through
    :func:`pipefy_mcp.core.transport_security.transport_security_for`, and only the
    HTTP transport has anything to apply it to.

    Building the engine here is safe off the event loop: it does no network I/O and
    binds nothing to a running loop (its endpoints open a fresh per-request
    transport at call time), so the engine built at startup serves whatever loop
    later handles requests.

    This is a stepping stone toward a single per-app runtime; today it owns the
    shared engine and the inbound-auth pair.
